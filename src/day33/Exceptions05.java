    /* What is the difference between "throw" and "throws" keywords?
    1- "throw" is used inside the method body, "throws" is used between method paranthesis and opening crly brace
    2- After "throw" we type ==> new+ constructor of exception class
       After "throws" we type ==> name of the exception class
    3- We can throw multiple exceptions by using just one "throws" keyword
       We can not throw multiple exceptions by using just one throw keyword
       If you want to throw more than 1 exceptions y using "throw" keyword you have tp type "throw" per each
    4- "throws" is used for the possible problems which Java knows
       "throw" is used for the possible problems which we decide
